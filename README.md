📍 Public Theory Disclosure by RJ Marler (August 5, 2025)

This is a formal timestamped disclosure of a novel theory and computational framework titled:

> **Vector Tongue: A Multi-Model Alignment and Predictive Drift Engine for Language Models**

🧠 **Core Idea:**  
Vector Tongue is a method for aligning and comparing the embedding outputs of different large language models (LLMs) by calculating cosine similarity, vector deltas, and "drift scores" across responses to a shared prompt. It enables semantic translation between models, prediction of one model’s output from another, and the detection of non-obvious divergence in reasoning, tone, or structure.

📐 **Key Mechanisms (IP-relevant):**  
- Embedding extraction (e.g. via OpenAI `text-embedding-3-small`) of LLM outputs.  
- Cosine similarity between model output embeddings.  
- Vector delta: `delta = vec2 - vec1`  
- Drift score formula: `(1 - cosine_similarity) * ||delta||`  
- Reverse prediction: `predicted_vec = vec1 + delta`  
- Optional reconstruction or decoding of predicted vectors.

📌 **Use Cases Include (but not limited to):**  
- AI interpretability and meta-alignment  
- Multi-model consensus engines  
- Drift auditing and version regression testing  
- Predictive simulation of unqueried models  
- Semantic reverse translation layers  
- Model interoperability layers across closed and open LLMs
