# üö© Vector Tongue: A Novel Framework for Multi-Model LLM Drift Detection and Prediction

**Core Premise:**  
Vector Tongue is a novel AI alignment and interpretability method that analyzes the divergence and alignment of outputs from multiple large language models (LLMs) using embedding space comparison.

It introduces a **predictive simulation layer** capable of estimating one model's response **without directly querying it**, using the following process:
1. Generate response from Model A.
2. Extract its embedding vector using a static embedding model (e.g. `text-embedding-3-small`).
3. Compute `delta = vecB - vecA` using previously known outputs or calibration runs.
4. Use that delta to simulate:  
   `predicted_vecB = vecA + delta`
5. Optionally decode `predicted_vecB` via vector retrieval or generative similarity mapping.

### üß† Key Mechanisms:

- **Cross-model Embedding Alignment**  
  Compare how different LLMs respond to the same prompt using cosine similarity between their output embeddings.

- **Delta Drift Vector**  
  Compute `delta = vec2 - vec1` between two model outputs. This captures the directional "drift" in conceptual space.

- **Drift Score**  
  `drift = (1 - cosine_similarity) * np.linalg.norm(delta)`  
  A normalized measurement that combines similarity and displacement to assess interpretive or tonal drift.

- **Predictive Simulation Layer**  
  Predict unseen model responses using:  
  `predicted_vec = vec1 + delta`  
  Then infer possible output meaning via embedding lookup or comparison.

### üîç Applications:
- Model auditing and AI safety (detect hidden shifts in tone or logic)
- Multi-agent communication (LLM-to-LLM semantic bridges)
- Interpretability benchmarking (for fine-tuning or policy tracing)
- Response prediction in compute-limited environments
- Reverse engineering of proprietary model behavior patterns
